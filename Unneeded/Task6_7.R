# Tasks 6 and 7 - Data Product and Slide Deck
# 
# Tasks to accomplish
# Create a data product to show off your prediction algorithm. Create a Shiny app that accepts an n-gram as input and predicts the next word.
# Create a slide deck promoting your product. Write 5 slides using RStudio Presenter explaining your product and why it is awesome!
# 

# 
# Questions to consider
# What are the most interesting ways you could show off your algorithm?
# Are there any data visualizations you think might be helpful? (Look at the SwiftKey data dashboard if you have it loaded on your phone.)
# How should you document the use of your data product (separately from how you created it) so that others can rapidly deploy your algorithm?
